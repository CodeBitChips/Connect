Naveed Bhai,
Thank you for connecting with me a few days ago. I saw on your profile that you have worked with Enigma from almost 7 years. I am very interested in the company and what they do, because I applied for the job there. If possible, can you share your experience of Enigma with me? Can we have a 15 minutes chat to talk about this? I won't take too much time. Aap ka bohot shukria.
